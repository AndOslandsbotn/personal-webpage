### Summary
_Supervisors: Prof. Alexander Cloninger, Dr. Zeljko Kereta & Dr. Nickolas Forsch_

My PhD focused on developing scalable and reliable learning algorithms for large, high-dimensional datasets, with an emphasis on streaming and parallelization.

Grounded in statistical learning theory, I designed learning methods that reformulate classical algorithms into multi-resolution and boosting-style frameworks, enabling efficient training and inference under realistic memory and compute limits. Key contributions include:

- StreaMRAK: A multi-resolution, boosting-based learning framework supporting streaming data and adaptive model complexity

- Localized and hierarchical representation learning method for high-dimensional data, compatible with distributed and incremental computation

- Applications to large-scale datasets and inverse problems, demonstrating reliable performance with significantly reduced computational cost

Overall, the work focus on theoretical guarantees and practical scalability, with relevance to perception, representation learning, and learning systems used in computer vision and robotics.

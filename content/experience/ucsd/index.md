### Summary
_Supervisor: Prof. Alexander cloninger_ 

As part of my PhD I completed a Research stay at UCSD working with Prof. Alexander Cloninger and Prof. Yoav Freund, the main focus was scalable representation learning for high-dimensional data.

- Developed methods for low-dimensional representations that preserve local structure while remaining computationally scalable

- Developed a graph-based embedding approach that scales to large datasets through localization and parallelization, avoiding the quadratic complexity of classical spectral methods

- Introduced a hierarchical coordinate system that enables local, zoomed-in analysis of subsets of data without recomputing global embeddings

- Demonstrated the method on large-scale datasets, including MNIST and word-embedding corpora, highlighting practical scalability and interpretability

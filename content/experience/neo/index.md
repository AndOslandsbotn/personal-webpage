### Summary

As part of the hyperspectral imaging group at Norsk Elektro Optikk, I worked on improving image quality and signal robustness in their hyperspectral camera systems.

- Designed and evaluated low-pass and band-limited filters to improve signal quality

- Used Fourier analysis to identify camera and sensor related issues

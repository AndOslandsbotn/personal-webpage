### Thesis — Summary
- Developed a gradient-based shape optimisation framework combined with the multimesh finite element method, avoiding costly re-meshing of moving objects.

- Derived a novel analytical shape gradient for the Stokes-drag problem using the adjoint approach and Hadamard’s theorem.

- Validated the method numerically, demonstrating accurate gradients near extrema and competitive performance on relevant benchmarks.
